# SRV_Yuthony
It is developed for TafeSA, Australia.
Student Results View project - c# application in UWP

The issue of the current system we wish to address is that:
For the academic transcipt we have access to as students dosen't give us an indication of the courses progress through a qualification
nor the ability to apply for parchments.
We are developing an application to try to find the solution for TafeSA and the representive of our client: Trevor Learey.

Note: This application connects to the copied database with dummy data on student servser through internet.

Login Page-
The system will do a security check and search if the input userid exists in the database and identify if the user is login as a lecturer or a student by the input userid

Search student Page-
If the user is identified as a lecturer the system will navigates to search student page
In this page, a combo-box dispplays all students in the system with their student id.

Results_Student_View Page-
After the lecturer selected a certain student or it is just a simple student from login page, system will navigates to this page.
It will display the details of a particular student and a combo-box contains all the qualifications which this student intakes.
with the selection of a particular qualification, the system will display all the competencies and progress through this qualification.

-If the qualification is completed (which means: passed units are equal or greater than required units). The student will be able to apply for parchment. Or the lecturer will be able to approve or disapprove the parchment. 

-If the qualification is not yet completed, The system will display all the competencies which are graded, plus other potential competencies the student can enroll in regards their study plans
